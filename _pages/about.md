I am Bowen Tang (唐博文), a second-year Pure Mathematics PhD candidate at [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn), under the supervision of Professor [Yi Xie](https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/content/lists/11_catid74_zmx.html). 

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Peking University in 2024.
